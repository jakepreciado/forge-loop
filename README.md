# Welcome to ForgeLoop!
## Overview

This project is a C++ console application that simulates a basic turn-based combat game. The game allows a player character to battle multiple enemies, using normal attacks, healing, and special attacks. The goal of this project is to further my understanding of C++ programming concepts, including classes, inheritance, virtual functions, STL data structures, loops, conditionals, and functions.

The purpose of creating this game was to practice object-oriented programming and to prepare for more advanced game development concepts, such as those used in game engines like Unreal Engine. The project demonstrates how to structure a small game loop, handle player input, and implement polymorphic behavior with a base `Actor` class and derived `Player` and `Enemy` classes.

## Development Environment

- **IDE/Editor:** Microsoft Visual Studio 
- **Programming Language:** C++  
- **Libraries/Tools:** Standard Template Library (STL) for vectors, standard iostream for console input/output  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

## Useful Websites

- [Cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com) — Reference for C++ syntax, STL, and object-oriented features  
- [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/) — Detailed documentation for C++ standard library and language features  

## Future Work

- Add a leveling sytem for scaling player and enemy stats  
- Implement a save/load system to store game progress  
- Add more player actions, such as items or defensive moves  
- Improve console output formatting
